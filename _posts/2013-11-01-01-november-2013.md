### 5 sets - vary order per set - show same times/set - 80-90% effort/round:

### [15 WB's - 20# to 10ft, 15 pushup burpees, 15 box jump step down - 30", 15 KBS - 1.5 pd, 50 DU's]

### rest walk 5 min active b/t rds

56'13" for workout including rest.  Double unders and shoulder endurance (both shoulders, not injured one) were the limiting factors.  Air was good the whole time, energy high and lungs open. Need my arms strength to catch up.

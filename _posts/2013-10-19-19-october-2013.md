I tried and failed at 205lbs. This doesn't currently feel like a 1RM and I'm not getting under the bar, I did 10 195lb clean and jerks with less than 10 sec rest not too long ago, so here is an lift to work on technique.  I really like the clean and jerk.

## B. close grip bench press 18" - build to a max with a spotter if you can: 185lbs

This was a true 1RM, not a PR for me, but a PR after the rotator cuff tear.

I used coaches eye and figured out my right arm is going faster than my left, and getting out from my core.  Fixed them to a point, still fighting the shoulder but much better than even a month ago.

I had to travel for work but managed to find a small globo gym with a single spot for lifting on the 28th.  The trainer helped me scrap together the weights and collars to do oly lifts. That said, I didn't push very hard since there were machines only a couple feet behind me.

### A. PS - build to a max: lbs 135

It's a good weight, limited by right shoulder stability.  I can overhead squat ~ 195lbs in slow and stable, and look forward to stabilizing my shoulder more to put up more respectable weight.

### B. Wtd Dip - build to a max: 122 lbs

Definitely a max. Felt good but 100%

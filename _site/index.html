<p><strong>5 sets @ 80-90% constant times/vary order per set:
[20 DL - 135#, 20 WB's - 20# to 10ft, 60 DU's, 100 m bear crawl, Row 400 m]
rest walk 5 min b/t sets</strong></p>

<p>67'39" including rests.</p>

<p>The difficulty was in double unders. The 100m bear crawl went well - distance was initially intimidating but not really a problem.</p>

<p>I did feel that the lactic acid in shoulders was the limiting factor - more mental than anything - and made it hard to be at 90%. Need to work on pushing harder until my breathing is being challenged more.</p>

walk rest light 30 sec x 30 sets
(rest 3 min off bike every 10 sets)
+
5 min walk cool down</strong></p>

<p>Didn't have an AirDyne so I used the Rower.</p>

<p>Average pace was 1'42" / 500m.  Played around a lot with 90% concept.  It seems to be around a 1:38, but a couple of pulls at 1:33 and I have to slow down to recover.</p>

<h3>5 sets - vary order per set - show same times/set - 80-90% effort/round:</h3>

<h3>[15 WB's - 20# to 10ft, 15 pushup burpees, 15 box jump step down - 30", 15 KBS - 1.5 pd, 50 DU's]</h3>

<h3>rest walk 5 min active b/t rds</h3>

<p>56'13" for workout including rest.  Double unders and shoulder endurance (both shoulders, not injured one) were the limiting factors.  Air was good the whole time, energy high and lungs open. Need my arms strength to catch up.</p>

Tags: Power Snatch, Weighted Dip, Front Squat</p>

<p>I had to travel for work but managed to find a small globo gym with a single spot for lifting on the 28th.  The trainer helped me scrap together the weights and collars to do oly lifts. That said, I didn't push very hard since there were machines only a couple feet behind me.</p>

<h3>A. PS - build to a max: lbs 135</h3>

<p>It's a good weight, limited by right shoulder stability.  I can overhead squat ~ 195lbs in slow and stable, and look forward to stabilizing my shoulder more to put up more respectable weight.</p>

<h3>B. Wtd Dip - build to a max: 122 lbs</h3>

<p>Definitely a max. Felt good but 100%</p>

15 Push Up Burpees</p>

<p>Time: 47'55"</p>

<p>RPE: 8</p>

<p>Lungs were good the entire time, held a 2'0" row pace throughout. Limiting factor was getting the full pushup after the 6th round.</p>

<h3>1K Swim Time Trial: 25'10"</h3>

<p>It's been about ten years since I have done laps in a pool.  Felt great, challenge was syncing my breath and shoulder endurance.  Mixed freestyle with combat side-stroke and a couple laps of frog stroke.</p>

<p>10k X-Country Run: 61'26"</p>

<p>I ran a race route I found online through trails with hills and a lot of turns, but a fun run.</p>

<p>RPE was 7 for most of the run, at 45 minutes it went to 9/10 for about 3 minutes at the top of the 274ft hill. I lost control of my breathing and legs got really heavy. Didn't stop and pushed through, but I want to solve it since it happened in the row as well.</p>

<p>Total Elevation: 540ft / 540ft.</p>

<h2>A. power clean - build to a max: 195lbs</h2>

<iframe style='height: 315px; width: 100%; border: 0;' src='http://www.coachseye.com/fBbT/e'></iframe>


<p>I tried and failed at 205lbs. This doesn't currently feel like a 1RM and I'm not getting under the bar, I did 10 195lb clean and jerks with less than 10 sec rest not too long ago, so here is an lift to work on technique.  I really like the clean and jerk.</p>

<h2>B. close grip bench press 18" - build to a max with a spotter if you can: 185lbs</h2>

<iframe style='height: 315px; width: 100%; border: 0;' src='http://www.coachseye.com/EyB0/e'></iframe>


<p>This was a true 1RM, not a PR for me, but a PR after the rotator cuff tear.</p>

<h2>C. AMRAP DU's in 5 min: 48</h2>

<iframe style='height: 315px; width: 100% ; border: 0;' src='http://www.coachseye.com/1Cpn/e'></iframe>


<p>I used coaches eye and figured out my right arm is going faster than my left, and getting out from my core.  Fixed them to a point, still fighting the shoulder but much better than even a month ago.</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/26816441/images/60m_Row_17OCT13_JPG.jpg" alt="Row Distance for 60 minutes" /></p>

<p>RPE: 6 for most of the time, breathing solid, got hard at 50 - 55 minutes, then sprint was easy. Felt great afterward, could push harder.</p>

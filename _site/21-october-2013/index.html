<p>10k X-Country Run: 61'26"</p>

<p>I ran a race route I found online through trails with hills and a lot of turns, but a fun run.</p>

<p>RPE was 7 for most of the run, at 45 minutes it went to 9/10 for about 3 minutes at the top of the 274ft hill. I lost control of my breathing and legs got really heavy. Didn't stop and pushed through, but I want to solve it since it happened in the row as well.</p>

<p>Total Elevation: 540ft / 540ft.</p>

<p><strong>5 sets @ 80-90% constant times/vary order per set:
[20 DL - 135#, 20 WB's - 20# to 10ft, 60 DU's, 100 m bear crawl, Row 400 m]
rest walk 5 min b/t sets</strong></p>

<p>67'39" including rests.</p>

<p>The difficulty was in double unders. The 100m bear crawl went well - distance was initially intimidating but not really a problem.</p>

<p>I did feel that the lactic acid in shoulders was the limiting factor - more mental than anything - and made it hard to be at 90%. Need to work on pushing harder until my breathing is being challenged more.</p>

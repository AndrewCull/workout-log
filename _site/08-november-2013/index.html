<p><strong>3 hr march - 20# pack - start slightly hungry, eat on way at 2 points small amounts, prefer changing terrain. Record distance and pace - constant movement.</strong></p>

<p>8.5 miles total, 4137' vertical in 2 hrs 36".</p>

<p>Had to mess around with parking permits so time was tight.  This another good time trial that I can get back to easily.</p>
